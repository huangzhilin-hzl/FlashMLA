# Measured full-target results

B300 physical GPU1; b8192, H64, D576/512, TopK2048, chunk3. Each row is a paired warm CUDA-event run with 3 warmups and 5 repeats. All listed runs passed the original 8-row FP32-reference check; this is sampled numerical validation. v002/v003 were later found memory-unsafe and are rejected. NCU metrics are from separate profiled invocations.

Raw JSON records exact tensor shapes, seed, software versions, candidate SHA256 and unchanged benchmark SHA256. The baseline B0 used 20 warmups/100 repeats and measured 1860.70 µs warm / 1854.66 µs cold; use the paired baseline for each ratio because clocks vary. No iteration has yet matched TRTLLM.
